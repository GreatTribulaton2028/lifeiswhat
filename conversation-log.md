## Entries

### Entry 1 (2026-01-31)

- Initial discussion about the goal of the website: a platform focusing on life and death news records, linking current events, the seven-year tribulation, the Bible, the gospel, and other information.

- Purpose: Guide visitors from no interest to curiosity, awareness of news, disasters, wars, economic changes, and then to questions about life, death, afterlife, and ultimately lead them to consider the gospel. For believers, encourage further thought on end times.

- Request: Open a dedicated page to record conversations for future AI or human reference.
