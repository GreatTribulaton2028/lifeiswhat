#### Entry 5 (2026-02-03) – UX Flow Restructuring & Evangelism Logic
**Summary**: Redefined the user journey for "stubborn" users (believers and non-believers) based on data-driven evidence rather than emotional persuasion. Outlined the specific flow for the Evangelism page.

**User Constraints & Context**:
- User condition: Eye strain/back pain, working on older hardware.
- Target Audience: People with "prefrontal cortex rigidity" (stubborn, hard-hearted).
- Strategy: Use "Live Signals" (Telegram/News) and "Coincidence Detection" (Timeline) to bypass emotional defense mechanisms.

**Updated Roadmap**:
1.  **Phase 1: Index (Landing)**
    - Must feature **Real-time Death Counter** (needs sync/accuracy).
    - *Missing Link*: Restore the "Life vs. Death" interstitial page (currently lost/removed by AI).

2.  **Phase 2: Monitor (The Hook)**
    - **Goal**: "Vital Life Monitor" – The evidence hub.
    - **UI Requirements**: Needs beautification, Statistical Charts, Date Range Query, Clickable Source Links (back to news).
    - **Content Strategy**: "Abnormality Index" (thermometer), "Live Signals" (Telegram feed).
    - **Navigation Change**: The bottom-right box (formerly "7-Year Tribulation") will now lead to the **Evangelism Page**.

3.  **Phase 3: Timeline (The Conversion)**
    - Use side-by-side comparison (News vs. Scripture).
    - Button: "Is this a coincidence?" (Statistical approach).

4.  **Phase 4: Evangelism Page (The Exit)**
    - **Behavior**: Single Page Application (SPA) feel – No page jumps to reduce friction.
    - **Flow**:
        1. User clicks "Amen" (Prayer).
        2. **Immediate Action**: Reveal "Gospel Bridge" (Mandarin) and "Five Colors Gospel" (Cantonese) videos/content on the same page.
        3. **Timer**: After 4 minutes (video duration), reveal secondary buttons.
        4. **Secondary Buttons**:
            - "Learn More" -> Links to pCloud Christian Resources.
            - "Return to Portal" -> Links back to Index (Death Numbers).

**Open Items**:
- **7-Year Tribulation Placement**: Since its original spot (Monitor bottom-right) is now for Evangelism, a new entry point is needed. *Suggestion: A "Deep Analysis" or "Warning" toggle within the Monitor or Timeline.*
